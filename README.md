## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/a-pathfinding-algo-with-custom-walls-on-python.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd a-pathfinding-algo-with-custom-walls-on-python
    ```

3. Run the pathfinding algorithm:

    ```bash
    python pathfinding.py
    ```

## Custom Walls

Adjust the `custom_walls` parameter in the `pathfinding.py` file to customize walls.

```python
custom_walls = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]  # Add wall coordinates as tuples
